## Have you ever wondered? Analysis of the Airbnb rentals for Mexico City
The objective of this project is to answer 4 questions regarding the Airbnb rentals of Mexico City.<br>
I have 2 questions as a User and 2 questions for possible Host or rental owner.

### Questions:
1. How many days before a main holiday should I reserve to still have several options?
2. If I want to try to avoid crowded places or traffic jams on the highway, which day of the week should I travel?
3. What neighborhood is the best for having an Airbnb in Mexico City?
4. Does the size matter? What are the most important features to have a high occupancy?
